the more recent S21. I thought it would be a good idea to run a quick comparison regarding the camera performance of these
three devices. Note that the S9 was release in March 2018, S10+ in March 2019 and S21 in Jan 2021. To have an idea about
the official camera specs I've attached a comparison from gsmarena bellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:90%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/camera-specs.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison is based on a series of very basic day-to-day shots (in "auto" mode) we all take with our phones and the 
images are available at their full resolution if you click on them. They appear from left to right in order 
of device release date, from earliest to latest (i.e. S9, S10+, S21). Let's start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 1 (outdoors) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three look about the same, with some differences in exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/bus-full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/bus.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a closer look, I think that in S21 (and probably s20) they decided to move away from the over-sharpening
approach followed in S10+ which produced weird artifacts like the way number "4" is captured, 
and the text in "want to drive this bus?". The photo from S21 seems to have more noise in some areas e.g. the red colour on the 
bus is a bit grainy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/bus-zoom-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/bus-zoom-1.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, less sharpening, less contrast and more detail in S21, in general I'm not a fan of the 
post-processing applied here, it looks less like a photo and more like a drawing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/bus-zoom-2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/bus-zoom-2.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 2 (outdoors) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar setup as in the previous example, negligible differences between the three cameras. The same comments as 
before apply for the sharpening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/southside-full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/southside.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 3 (indoors) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photo from S21 seems to have a wider dynamic range and better exposure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/pret-full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/pret.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/pret-zoom-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/pret-zoom-1.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
In the following cropped section the result from S21 is significantly better 
compared to S9 and S10+, mainly in terms of noise level and detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/pret-zoom-2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/pret-zoom-2.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 4 (zoom 2x) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decided to compare them at 2x zoom as S10+ has 2x optical zoom and S21 has a hybrid 3x zoom (using 1.1x optical zoom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/southside-inside-2x-full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/southside-inside-2x.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of optical zoom in S9 is obvious in this comparison. The hybrid zoom in S21 seems to produce a more 
detailed photo with lower levels of noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/southside-inside-2x-zoom-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/southside-inside-2x-zoom-1.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 5 (Outdoors wide-angle) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example the wide-angle camera is used on s10+ and s21. I've also taken the same photo with s9 to have it 
as a reference point (s9 doesn't have a wide-angle camera/lens).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/wide-full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/wide.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image from S21 is definitely sharper than the S10+,  without any unwanted artifacts caused by post-processing.
So far in the comparison I think it's the most obvious improvement brought by S21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/wide-zoom-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/wide-zoom-1.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/wide-zoom-2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/wide-zoom-2.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 6 (Low light indoors) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "night mode" was enabled in all three devices for this photo and there's also a fourth image coming from a Nikon 
D3400 DSLR to make the comparison a bit more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/night-avocado-full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/night-avocado.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S21 does a good job in this scenario as well, with good detail and very low noise (probably applying more extreme 
noise reduction during post-processing, however without affecting the image detail). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/night-avocado-zoom-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/night-avocado-zoom-1.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
To be able to take a photo without flash with the D3400 I had to use a pretty high ISO (128000) which caused a lot of
noise in the photo. With some post-processing it could look better but it's still not a great image. It's impressive
that modern smartphones can perform better than DSRLs in scenarios like this (at least "handheld" :D).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 7 (1080p Video) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to make the comparison a bit more thorough I've included two sample videos taken with the main camera
of each device. In one of them I'm walking while recording to capture some of the image stabilisation properties
of the devices. In hindsight, I could have captured 4k video with all three devices, but apart from the lower 
resolution, 1080p should be ok to get an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Verdict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more recent S21 seems to be the best performer in this test. However, the differences between the S10+ and S21 are minimal 
and even comparing with the 3-year older S9, the differences are not massive. Going from S9 or S10 to S21 just for the minor
camera improvements wouldn't make a lot of sense. Nevertheless, I really enjoy other features of S21 so far, like the 120hz 
refresh rate of the screen which really makes a difference in comparison to S9/S10 (note though that it was also available 
in s20 so not an exclusive new feature of S21) and the faster cpu.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Photography"></category><category term="photography"></category></entry><entry><title>Testing how sharp Nikkor 24mm f/2.8 AF-D is on Nikon FX</title><link href="https://nicktgr15.github.io/testing-how-sharp-nikkor-24mm-f28-af-d-is-on-nikon-fx.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-10T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-10T14:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>nicktgr15</name></author><id>tag:nicktgr15.github.io,2020-01-10:/testing-how-sharp-nikkor-24mm-f28-af-d-is-on-nikon-fx.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;During the covid-Christmas period I got a Nikkor 24mm f/2.8 AF-D ultra-wide lens for my Nikon D610 Fx series full-frame

camera.  I got the lens from ebay for 138 GBP including postage which was a great price. For your information, this particular
model of the lens was released in 1994, some time before Nikon DSLRs were a thing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:40%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/24mm.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I took some photos with the above gear combination and wasn't happy with the image quality, an example photo can be seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:70%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/example-shot-24mm.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you check the bottom left corner of the image you'll notice it's quite blurry. The photo was taken with the 
following settings f/4, iso 100, 1/4000s. I was focusing to infinity, so that's part of the problem as with f/4 subjects
closer to the camera will be out of focus but in any case the effect wasn't pleasing to the eye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:70%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/example-zoom.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the above I decided to take a shot using the full range of available apertures and see what works for me 
going forward. If anything worked for me in the end, as there was always a chance this lens wasn't good enough for my 
use case (which is still TBD, but I love sharp photos :-D). I knew before getting the lens that sharpness in the corners was 
not great with smaller f numbers, but wasn't expecting it to be that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My test was very naive, and I was optimising for minimal effort on a Sunday morning. I took 6 photos 
(f2.8, f4, f8, f11, f16, f22) handheld, with a horrible sky that is impossible to not overexpose in Wandsworth Town, London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test photos were like the following. This particular one was taken with f/11, iso 2200, 1/320s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:70%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/test-photo.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bellow you can see 100% crops for the highlighted red boxes with all 6 apertures. The left box was chosen because
it's closer to the  edge of the image whereas the one in the middle is closer to the center. I chose these two 
because they contain text which makes it a bit easier to assess sharpness (without special tooling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corner sharpness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:90%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/corners.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Center sharpness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:90%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/center.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not included the iso and exposure values used but I was shooting in aperture priority mode so you can make 
your guesses. Obviously under the particular weather/light conditions noise was becoming an issue for smaller apertures
but I don't think it affects the results of the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conclusion for now is that something between f/8 and f/11 is going to work for me. For landscapes with good light 
or using a tripod I think I could live with the Nikkor f/2.8 AF-D 24mm. Will avoid anything bellow f5.6 
most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
