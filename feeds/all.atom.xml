There's at least two cohorts of guitar enthusiasts. In the first one, they believe that only
the capacitance (its size, in Farads) of the capacitor has impact on the frequency response and the type of the capacitor
doesn't matter. In the second, they believe that both, the size and type matter. There's a number of in-depth articles 
(&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030807122631/http://capacitors.com/picking_capacitors/pickcap.htm#intro"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;)
where the impact of the type of capacitor on tone is discussed but I'll keep it at a high level here. The main point
is that the construction and materials of the capacitor lead to non-ideal behaviour e.g. 
the capacitance can be frequency dependant, the capacitance can be temperature dependant, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article has two main sections, the first one has a bit of theory to better understand how the actual R and C
values of the low-pass filter affect the frequency response of the guitar. The second section describes the setup of
an experiment where different types of capacitors (of the same capacitance) were used to assess their impact on tone
by playing a number of samples on a guitar. The test specifically focuses on the capacitor used the in passive 
low-pass RC filter employed in the tone control section of your guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A bit of theory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below I've tried to model the circuit of a guitar with a single pickup (used the specs of a Seymour Duncan JB), 
a volume pot and a tone pot. In the blue circle I've highlighted the components used in the tone filter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:95%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/tone-circuit.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching it as an RC filter (although it's not exactly an RC filter), there is a cutoff frequency
where the gain of the of the circuit is -3dB. The cutoff frequency for an RC filter is given by the following
formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$f_{cutoff} = \frac{1}{2\pi RC}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area between 0 Hz and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f_{cutoff}\)&lt;/span&gt; defines the bandwidth of the filter. The circuit in our guitars is a bit more 
complicated than a simple RC filter but it's safe to assume that the bandwidth of the filter is inversely proportional
to the resistance of the tone pot and the capacitance of the tone capacitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A filter with a wider bandwidth will have more treble whereas a filter with a narrower bandwidth will have less treble.
The bandwidth on the guitar is controlled using the tone pot variable resistor and bellow I have two examples of the
frequency response retrieved by running a circuit simulator. One with
the pot set to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(300k\Omega\)&lt;/span&gt; (which is equivalent to having the tone at around 7-8 - for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(500k\Omega\)&lt;/span&gt;, logarithmic pots), 
in the second example the tone pot is set to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(100k\Omega\)&lt;/span&gt; (tone at around 4-5). As we can see the filter bandwidth
gets narrower, the smaller the value of the tone pot becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:95%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/filter-bandwidth.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, (and as expected from the RC filter formula) changing the value of the capacitor will also have an impact on
the bandwidth. Bellow I've set the tone pot to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(30k\Omega\)&lt;/span&gt; and then I did run the simulation with an &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(11nF\)&lt;/span&gt; capacitor 
and then with a  &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(44nF\)&lt;/span&gt; capacitor. In the latter, the filter bandwidth gets narrower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:95%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/filter-bandwidth-capacitor.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the question is, what happens when we keep the value of the capacitor as is but we change the type of the capacitor.
I didn't run a simulation for that, although it might be possible if we use a more realistic model of a non-ideal
capacitor. Instead, I run a test, which I'll describe below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to do quick A/B comparisons between capacitors without having to use a soldering iron I built a simple
circuit that allows to connect up to 5 different capacitors and enable one (or more - as I'm using latching switches) at a time.
As already mentioned a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(500k\Omega\)&lt;/span&gt; tone pot is used along with the following capacitors (capacitance, as measured
with a multimeter, indicated in brackets):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange Drop  (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(21.52 nF\)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paper-in-Oil  (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(26.47 nF\)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polystyrene  (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(22.35 nF\)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polyester Film  (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(22.35 nF\)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ceramic  (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(22.94 nF\)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paper-in-Oil capacitor is slightly larger than the nominal value, but it's not a huge difference and 
shouldn't have significant impact on the filter shape. The small circuit board was wired directly between the tone pot
and the ground on a Yamaha AES 620 guitar with 2 volume pots, a single tone pot and a toggle switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four different samples were performed, every sample was played five times, once per capacitor type. 
The guitar pickup and the tone pot value was as follows for the four samples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample 1: Bridge pickup (Seymour Duncan JB)  / Tone pot at 70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample 2: Bridge pickup (Seymour Duncan JB) / Tone pot at 70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample 3: Neck pickup (Seymour Duncan Jazz)  / Tone pot at 30% &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample 4: Bridge pickup (Seymour Duncan JB) / Tone pot at 70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't share my thoughts around the results yet as I don't want to influence your assessment.

the more recent S21. I thought it would be a good idea to run a quick comparison regarding the camera performance of these
three devices. Note that the S9 was release in March 2018, S10+ in March 2019 and S21 in Jan 2021. To have an idea about
the official camera specs I've attached a comparison from gsmarena bellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:90%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/camera-specs.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison is based on a series of very basic day-to-day shots (in "auto" mode) we all take with our phones and the 
images are available at their full resolution if you click on them. They appear from left to right in order 
of device release date, from earliest to latest (i.e. S9, S10+, S21). Let's start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 1 (outdoors) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three look about the same, with some differences in exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/bus-full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/bus.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a closer look, I think that in S21 (and probably s20) they decided to move away from the over-sharpening
approach followed in S10+ which produced weird artifacts like the way number "4" is captured, 
and the text in "want to drive this bus?". The photo from S21 seems to have more noise in some areas e.g. the red colour on the 
bus is a bit grainy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/bus-zoom-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/bus-zoom-1.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, less sharpening, less contrast and more detail in S21, in general I'm not a fan of the 
post-processing applied here, it looks less like a photo and more like a drawing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/bus-zoom-2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/bus-zoom-2.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 2 (outdoors) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar setup as in the previous example, negligible differences between the three cameras. The same comments as 
before apply for the sharpening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/southside-full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/southside.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 3 (indoors) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photo from S21 seems to have a wider dynamic range and better exposure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/pret-full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/pret.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/pret-zoom-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/pret-zoom-1.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
In the following cropped section the result from S21 is significantly better 
compared to S9 and S10+, mainly in terms of noise level and detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/pret-zoom-2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/pret-zoom-2.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 4 (zoom 2x) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decided to compare them at 2x zoom as S10+ has 2x optical zoom and S21 has a hybrid 3x zoom (using 1.1x optical zoom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/southside-inside-2x-full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/southside-inside-2x.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of optical zoom in S9 is obvious in this comparison. The hybrid zoom in S21 seems to produce a more 
detailed photo with lower levels of noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/southside-inside-2x-zoom-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/southside-inside-2x-zoom-1.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 5 (Outdoors wide-angle) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example the wide-angle camera is used on s10+ and s21. I've also taken the same photo with s9 to have it 
as a reference point (s9 doesn't have a wide-angle camera/lens).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/wide-full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/wide.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image from S21 is definitely sharper than the S10+,  without any unwanted artifacts caused by post-processing.
So far in the comparison I think it's the most obvious improvement brought by S21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/wide-zoom-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/wide-zoom-1.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/wide-zoom-2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/wide-zoom-2.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 6 (Low light indoors) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "night mode" was enabled in all three devices for this photo and there's also a fourth image coming from a Nikon 
D3400 DSLR to make the comparison a bit more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/night-avocado-full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/night-avocado.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S21 does a good job in this scenario as well, with good detail and very low noise (probably applying more extreme 
noise reduction during post-processing, however without affecting the image detail). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/night-avocado-zoom-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/night-avocado-zoom-1.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
To be able to take a photo without flash with the D3400 I had to use a pretty high ISO (128000) which caused a lot of
noise in the photo. With some post-processing it could look better but it's still not a great image. It's impressive
that modern smartphones can perform better than DSRLs in scenarios like this (at least "handheld" :D).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example 7 (1080p Video) &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to make the comparison a bit more thorough I've included two sample videos taken with the main camera
of each device. In one of them I'm walking while recording to capture some of the image stabilisation properties
of the devices. In hindsight, I could have captured 4k video with all three devices, but apart from the lower 
resolution, 1080p should be ok to get an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Verdict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more recent S21 seems to be the best performer in this test. However, the differences between the S10+ and S21 are minimal 
and even comparing with the 3-year older S9, the differences are not massive. Going from S9 or S10 to S21 just for the minor
camera improvements wouldn't make a lot of sense. Nevertheless, I really enjoy other features of S21 so far, like the 120hz 
refresh rate of the screen which really makes a difference in comparison to S9/S10 (note though that it was also available 
in s20 so not an exclusive new feature of S21) and the faster cpu.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Photography"></category><category term="photography"></category></entry><entry><title>Testing how sharp Nikkor 24mm f/2.8 AF-D is on Nikon FX</title><link href="https://nicktgr15.github.io/testing-how-sharp-nikkor-24mm-f28-af-d-is-on-nikon-fx.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-10T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-01-10T14:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>nicktgr15</name></author><id>tag:nicktgr15.github.io,2021-01-10:/testing-how-sharp-nikkor-24mm-f28-af-d-is-on-nikon-fx.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;During the covid-Christmas period I got a Nikkor 24mm f/2.8 AF-D ultra-wide lens for my Nikon D610 Fx series full-frame

camera.  I got the lens from ebay for 138 GBP including postage which was a great price. For your information, this particular
model of the lens was released in 1994, some time before Nikon DSLRs were a thing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:40%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/24mm.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I took some photos with the above gear combination and wasn't happy with the image quality, an example photo can be seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:70%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/example-shot-24mm.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you check the bottom left corner of the image you'll notice it's quite blurry. The photo was taken with the 
following settings f/4, iso 100, 1/4000s. I was focusing to infinity, so that's part of the problem as with f/4 subjects
closer to the camera will be out of focus but in any case the effect wasn't pleasing to the eye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:70%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/example-zoom.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the above I decided to take a shot using the full range of available apertures and see what works for me 
going forward. If anything worked for me in the end, as there was always a chance this lens wasn't good enough for my 
use case (which is still TBD, but I love sharp photos :-D). I knew before getting the lens that sharpness in the corners was 
not great with smaller f numbers, but wasn't expecting it to be that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My test was very naive, and I was optimising for minimal effort on a Sunday morning. I took 6 photos 
(f2.8, f4, f8, f11, f16, f22) handheld, with a horrible sky that is impossible to not overexpose in Wandsworth Town, London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test photos were like the following. This particular one was taken with f/11, iso 2200, 1/320s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:70%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/test-photo.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bellow you can see 100% crops for the highlighted red boxes with all 6 apertures. The left box was chosen because
it's closer to the  edge of the image whereas the one in the middle is closer to the center. I chose these two 
because they contain text which makes it a bit easier to assess sharpness (without special tooling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corner sharpness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:90%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/corners.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Center sharpness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:90%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/center.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not included the iso and exposure values used but I was shooting in aperture priority mode so you can make 
your guesses. Obviously under the particular weather/light conditions noise was becoming an issue for smaller apertures
but I don't think it affects the results of the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conclusion for now is that something between f/8 and f/11 is going to work for me. For landscapes with good light 
or using a tripod I think I could live with the Nikkor f/2.8 AF-D 24mm. Will avoid anything bellow f5.6 
most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

Since, at that point I was satisfying all the criteria of my university (most importantly the number of publications) 
we agreed that I should start writing my dissertation and have my Viva before Christmas. 
At that point I only had the latex template of my Thesis and a first version of the table of contents and abstract. 
In parallel, I was trying to finish and submit my latest paper, which although was not a prerequisite to 
present my Thesis, was a brilliant way to summarize all the great work done in the deep learning space during the 
last 18 months. The experiments were finalised but I did spend another month refining the paper and reviewing it 
with my supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The writing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October I had a clear plan in my head regarding what should be included in my Thesis. The majority of the 
chapters would be based on my publications and that was the "easy" part. The "more challenging" part would 
be the introductory chapters and the conclusions. In the former, the problem and the research questions would have to 
be defined in a clear way along with the theoretical framework that would allow readers to follow the subsequent chapters. 
The latter, would include my contributions to the field and as such it should be clear and precise. The writing 
"officially" started on the 3rd of October, however until 20 Oct I was still working in parallel on the paper
and then I was off for a week travelling for work. I was back on 27 Oct and I started from the "easy" part and 
whenever I was writing I was keeping track of time  and number of words produced. 
I already had examples of dissertations from previous PhD students in my 
lab which I used to  get an estimate of the number of words of a completed Thesis. It was a quite wide range, 
from 40k words to 90k words 
and although it did not mean too  much as an absolute value, it was super useful to be able to keep track of my 
progress using a quite accurate unit of measurement ..the word. I set a goal of 45k words, and since I had some 
estimates of my words/min rate from the first few days of writing, I could predict when I would be able to deliver 
the whole Thesis. Of course the rate  depends on many factors and one of the most important ones is whether you're 
writing the "easy" or the "more challenging" parts of the Thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:60%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/door-calendar.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
..focus on the "more challenging" parts where there was a significant higher number of unknowns
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it felt really hard at that point, I was confident that I should force myself to stop writing the "easy" parts 
and instead focus on the "more challenging" parts where there was a significant higher number of unknowns.
And that's exactly what I did. I had a printed calendar taped on one of the doors in my flat, and on it I was keeping track 
of my progress along with deadlines and important milestones. Remember that I still didn't have the exact date of my 
Viva but I had a specific week in my mind that could work. I was writing for 4-6 hours on weekdays after work and for 10-15 
hours on weekends with almost zero breaks. Although I didn't have a real deadline, I mean I could always ask my 
supervisor to move my Viva into the new year (Plan B), I really wanted to finish with my Viva as soon as possible so 
I was a 100% focused on Plan A, almost ignoring Plan B as an option. I kept my supervisor up to date 
based on my estimates and on the 4th of December we agreed that I'll have my Viva on the 13th of December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Some stats&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't miss the chance to add some stats on this post, so here they are, the number of words written
per day. The yellow annotation indicates the point when I changed the way I was measuring the number of words. 
For the record, I ended up using &lt;code&gt;pdftotext main.pdf  - | wc -w&lt;/code&gt;. The green annotation indicates the days I was 
on annual leave from work in order to increase my throughput and meet the deadline.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/phd-words.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Creating a presentation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation is the mechanism that will allow you to communicate your ideas in a clear way in a short amount of time
during the Viva, it's a tool. Most of the content comes from the Thesis but in many cases I had to either structure it 
differently or present it using some kind of diagram. The usual guidelines applying to any other kind of presentation apply 
to this one too i.e. avoid big blocks of text, visualise information when it makes sense, etc. The biggest part of my 
presentation was technical and focused on my contributions, however I needed to get the balance right for an audience that
would have different levels of knowledge in this field. Of course I had a sense of what's too complex to go into the
presentation but the safest way to decide that was by practicing. Practicing helped to identify
slides that were too complex to explain in less than a minute and also helped to get an estimate of the duration 
of the presentation. I was capturing videos of myself while practicing, I never watched most of them but were useful 
to measure time and check how I looked while presenting. My biggest concern was the words per minute rate as I tend
to speak fast, so the goal was to gradually make the sessions slightly longer by reducing my speech rate. I practiced 
the presentation somewhere between 10 and 20 times during a week. I reached a point where I knew exactly what I was going
to say for every slide and that was making me more confident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
The Thesis writing feels like the last few meters in a long run, don't expect it to be easy, treat it with respect,
 be cautious and smart.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Viva&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night before my Viva, there was a Christmas party in my university and most of the PhD students from my lab were 
there as well as my supervisor. Since I was feeling ready for the Viva I went for a drink, was good to see all of them
and relieved some of the stress I was feeling. I went home early, around midnight, and tried to sleep. Of course, in
terms of sleep it was one of the worst nights ever, woke up several times, was anxious, however I was feeling ok and 
ready in the morning. I went to my uni early, got the keys of the classroom where the Viva would take place and got there
to get familiar with the place, test the projector and my laptop, etc. You need to do that, especially if you haven't been
to that area for some time, as in your mind (or at least in my mind) everything is much more serious, 
much more strict and formal. The reality made me feel much better. Of course I realised that the colours on my slides, 
that looked perfectly fine on my laptop, looked quite fainted on the projector with the classroom lights on, but you can't
have everything, can you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:60%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/viva-classroom.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation went according to plan, the flow was close to perfect and I was quite relaxed. I even
noticed some tiny typos, that no-one else did, while I was presenting. There were no interruptions during the presentation.
After the end of it there were questions from the 7 professors of the Viva committee. They seemed to be happy with 
the presentation and my answers to their questions.Most questions were about them wanting to know more about a specific 
aspect of the presented work and it never felt like
an exam or something like that. After the end of the questions session we all went out of the room to allow 
the committee to decide if my Viva was successful or not. After
4-5 minutes they announced their decision to me and the audience, I was successful!  When the committee announced 
their decision to me I thanked them and told them that I was very very happy. 
What a relief, after 6 years. It felt like I should celebrate for the next 6 months!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A few things that I learned on the way and might help you too&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thesis writing feels like the last few meters in a long run, don't expect it to be easy, treat it with respect,
 be cautious and smart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set a goal while writing. For me counting words worked very well, for you something else might work better, but it's
definitely beneficial to keep track of progress and be able to see the end of the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be consistent and focused, sacrifice a bit more of your personal/socialising/weekend/evening time to get this out of the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thesis is yours, reviewing a long document is a bit different compared to the reviews of 10 page papers during 
your PhD. Not many people will have the chance or the time to read your work in its full extent. Accept it and 
take ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find someone who went through the whole process recently and learn as much as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that although I was doing a part time PhD, which is a lot of work, I was able to remain very 
productive at work. I would even say that I felt more productive when I was in that mindset with a higher daily workload.
However, that's probably unsustainable and it's good that I can now finally decide what to do with my free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What's next?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a bit weird after finishing my PhD, it felt like I didn't have something to look forward to. 
On the other hand, the last few years I had so many ideas that I wanted to materialize but were never getting "prioritized".
Hopefully, as soon as these ideas start getting shape and I start working towards new goals, this feeling will go away!
For now, I'm still enjoying this small break, doing some travelling, spending time with friends and family and every now
and then thinking "what's next?". &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Other"></category><category term="phd"></category><category term="thesis"></category><category term="viva"></category><category term="latex"></category><category term="git"></category></entry><entry><title>Building and benchmarking my own Deep-Learning server</title><link href="https://nicktgr15.github.io/building-and-benchmarking-my-own-deep-learning-server.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-21T10:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-21T10:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>nicktgr15</name></author><id>tag:nicktgr15.github.io,2018-01-21:/building-and-benchmarking-my-own-deep-learning-server.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;During the last 18 months I spent a lot of time reading about Deep Learning and experimenting in various problem

spaces where these techniques can be applied. As a big fan of cloud computing I relied mainly on AWS and their
&lt;code&gt;p2.xlarge&lt;/code&gt; spot instances to run my Deep Learning experiments. I automated almost everything using cloudformation and
I could have my GPU/Compute instance up and running in a couple of minutes. More recently and as the cryptocurrency madness
was taking off I realised that I had to increase my spot instance bidding price almost on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:80%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/bitcoin-vs-aws.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked the spot instance pricing charts on AWS and realised that there was huge fluctuation of the prices.
I'm not sure it's definitely the case but there might be some correlation between the current value of Bitcoin
and the AWS EC2 spot instance prices. I would expect Amazon to aim for a spot price that makes
p2/p3 instances not profitable for miners otherwise it would be very difficult to make resources available for other,
more meaningful, purposes like AI and other kinds of problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
I would expect Amazon to aim for a spot price that makes p2/p3 instances not profitable for miners
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the &lt;code&gt;p2.xlarge&lt;/code&gt; I was using, was employing a Tesla K80 GPU which is based on the previous generation Kepler architecture.
After checking a few benchmarks online it was clear that a Pascal architecture GPU with a similar amount of cores and memory
would be probably faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The p2.xlarge EC2 instance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;p2.xlarge&lt;/code&gt; EC2 instance is a virtual machine with the following specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;GPU Count&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;vCPU Count&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Memory&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Parallel Processing Cores&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;GPU Memory&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;61 GiB&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2496&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12 GiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon claims that the &lt;code&gt;p2.xlarge&lt;/code&gt; is using a &lt;code&gt;Tesla K80&lt;/code&gt; GPU however this is only &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; of the story.
The &lt;code&gt;Tesla K80&lt;/code&gt; specs on the &lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-k80.html"&gt;nvidia website&lt;/a&gt; mention 4992 cuda cores
&lt;em&gt;with a dual-GPU design&lt;/em&gt; and 24 GB of GDDR5 memory. Apparently the &lt;code&gt;K80&lt;/code&gt; is based on two &lt;code&gt;GK210&lt;/code&gt; chips on a single PCB
and in the way this particular VM is configured, only one of these chips is available to the user. So to be fair,
with a &lt;code&gt;p2.xlarge&lt;/code&gt; you have access to half the resources of a &lt;code&gt;Tesla K80&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
Amazon claims that the p2.xlarge is using a Tesla K80 GPU however this is only half of the story
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;My Server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, the system consists of the following components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Component&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;CPU&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Intel G4600&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;59.99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;RAM&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2 x Ballistix Sport LT 8GB (16GB)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;164.46&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PSU&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;EVGA 600 W1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;43.21&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Storage&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Samsung 850 EVO 250 SSD&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;82.87&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;GPU&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Palit GeForce GTX 1070 Ti JetStream 8GB GDDR5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;463.97&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Case&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Aerocool QS240 M-ATX&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;29.99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;903.34&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was to use a recent platform (Kaby Lake) in order to be as power efficient as possible and have the ability to upgrade
components in the future. It was quite difficult to find a GTX 1070 ti in stock online, for the record &lt;a href="http://amazon.co.uk"&gt;http://amazon.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; didn't have
any available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:70%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/pc.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking into account the current price of &lt;code&gt;p2.xlarge&lt;/code&gt; spot instance on AWS ($0.38 USD/0.27 GBP per hour) with the money
spent to build my server I could buy &lt;code&gt;140&lt;/code&gt; days of usage while with the standard price (0.70 GBP per hour) that number would be &lt;code&gt;54&lt;/code&gt; days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Power Consumption / Temperatures&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power consumption of the server was tested using a power meter and the results were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Idle (W)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Peak Load (W)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;27&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;180&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GPU temperature under load was &lt;code&gt;66&lt;/code&gt; degrees Celsius while the CPU never exceeded &lt;code&gt;50&lt;/code&gt; degrees with the stock cooler.
I was impressed by how small and thin CPU stock coolers are nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:30%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/stock-g4600.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;GTX 1070 Ti vs Tesla K80&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to compare the performance of the &lt;code&gt;GTX 1070 ti&lt;/code&gt; with (half of) the &lt;code&gt;Tesla K80&lt;/code&gt; used in the &lt;code&gt;p2.xlarge&lt;/code&gt; EC2 instance I executed
the same experiment/benchmark on both systems. The experiment was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A siamese LSTM deep neural network identifying similar or disimillar speakers (binary classification) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Keras was used for the network definition while Tensorflow was employed as the backend &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 1000 speakers from the Voxceleb dataset were used for training and testing purposes &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The execution time was captured using the &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;GTX 1070 Ti&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Train&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;300000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;samples&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;120000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;samples&lt;/span&gt;

The reason why I found this competition an interesting challenge was threefold: was for a good cause, was a good opportunity to apply recently acquired knowledge about convnets/tensorflow and finally, was a nice example of using spark as a parallel processing engine to speed up single-threaded applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with kaggle competitions, most of the time they follow the same pattern which involves a dataset, provided to the contestants, and a submission format, usually in csv, which must be used as a template to submit results back to kaggle. Kaggle has the corresponding ground truth data for the submissions of the contestants and based on a predefined metric function a result is calculated. In this case, the above were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dataset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The dataset consists of 18636 images used as test data and 949 images used as training data. In the case of training data, a second, annotated version of those 949 images is provided, in which each sea lion is annotated using a colored dot. The size of the provided dataset in bytes is close to 100GB, with 86GB comprising the test data and around 10GB the training data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submission format&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The classification results are submitted using the following csv format. The &lt;code&gt;test_id&lt;/code&gt; represents the test image from which the corresponding counts for each type of sea lion have been calculated. It's obvious that during the evaluation the only processing that takes place in kaggle is the comparison of the submitted results with the ground truth i.e. validation is quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_id,adult_males,subadult_males,adult_females,juveniles,pups
0,1,1,1,1,1
1,1,1,1,1,1
2,1,1,1,1,1
etc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation metric&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The submitted results are evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric, averaged over the available columns (i.e. for the different types of sea lions)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(RMSE_{avg} = \frac{1}{5}(\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{adult-males} - \hat{y}_{adult-males})^2} + ... + \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{pups} - \hat{y}_{pups})^2})\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Matching the Dots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to be more accurate: finding and counting the dots. The training dataset images come in two versions, a plain image and a dotted image. On the dotted image each dot represents the location of a sea lion, while its colour indicates the corresponding sea lion type/class. As already mentioned, there are 5 types/classes of sea lions in the training data &lt;code&gt;adult_males, subadult_males, adult_females, juveniles, pups&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/blob_detection.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above figure three different versions of an example training image are presented. On the left side, the dotted version, in the middle, the absolute difference between the dotted and non-dotted images and finally, on the right side, the 64x64 pixels bounding boxes indicating the actual regions of the image that will be used as training samples for each class. The Laplacian of Gaussian blob detection algorithm is used to get the locations of the dots appearing on the middle image and when those locations are retrieved the type/colour of the corresponding sea lion is extracted from the original dotted training image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole, devious procedure is required because of the way the training data were provided by the competition organisers (i.e. as part of the image) so the coordinates and class information need to be extracted through some kind of post-processing. For each training image a dictionary like the following is generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    &amp;quot;sea-lions&amp;quot;: {
        &amp;quot;adult_males&amp;quot;: [
                [dot_x, dot_y],
                ...
        ],
        &amp;quot;subadult_males&amp;quot;: [ ... ],
        &amp;quot;adult_females&amp;quot;: [ ... ],
        &amp;quot;juveniles&amp;quot;: [ ... ],
        &amp;quot;pups&amp;quot;: [ ... ],
    },
    &amp;quot;filename&amp;quot;: image_filename
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Spark sparks creative (and a bit unorthodox) thinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To speedup the above procedure, which was underutilising the multiple cores available on my macbook, an attempt to parallelise it using spark was made. Spark is quite straightforward to run locally in standalone mode, and will by default utilise all available cpu resources. As long as Java is installed, the binaries can be downloaded from &lt;a href="https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html"&gt;https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html&lt;/a&gt; and after extracting the contents of the archive a spark job can be executed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;./spark-2.1.1-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit my_pyspark_job.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this spark job we wanted to achieve the following:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From each training image extract metadata with the coordinates of the sea lions &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From each training image generate 64x64 thumbnails centered on the coordinates extracted in the previous step  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go through the actual code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pyspark.sql.functions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pyspark.sql.types&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pyspark&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SparkConf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SparkContext&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lines 7-9&lt;/strong&gt;: Spark job initialisation and metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;line 11&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;filepaths&lt;/code&gt; contains the absolute locations of the training images after some filtering to remove a subset of images flagged as inappropriate for training by the organisers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;line 14&lt;/strong&gt;: This is an example of a Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) in spark. The &lt;code&gt;parallelize&lt;/code&gt; function receives as input a list containing the available training images and using the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function applies the metadata extraction function &lt;code&gt;util.extract_training_data(training_image)&lt;/code&gt; to each one of them. In spark terminology, &lt;code&gt;parallelize&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; are considered "transformations" and as such no processing is triggered by them. The processing is triggered using an "action", which in this case is the &lt;code&gt;.collect()&lt;/code&gt; call which fetches the entire RDD to the driver. The RDD returned is a list with the metadata dictionaries described earlier.
The following screenshot from the spark ui shows that only one executor is created when running locally in standalone mode and that executor is able to execute 8 tasks in parallel which in this case is equal to the  4 cores x 2 threads of an intel i7 cpu.
&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;" src="images/executor.png"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lines 16-17&lt;/strong&gt;: Metadata written on disk in json form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;line 20&lt;/strong&gt;: Another RDD is formed here, this time &lt;code&gt;results&lt;/code&gt; contains the list of dicts created earlier while the map function &lt;code&gt;util.extract_training_images(image_metadata)&lt;/code&gt; receives as input one of those dicts. The map function generates 64x64 thumbnails centered on the dots detected in the previous step which are written on disk using the following template &lt;code&gt;img_&amp;lt;image-filename&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;class&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;thumbnail-no&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;offset&amp;gt;&amp;lt;extension&lt;/code&gt;. An offset of &lt;code&gt;[-1, 0, 1]&lt;/code&gt; is used to produce three thumbnails from each dot, two of which are not exactly centered but moved 1 pixel diagonally up and down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training a Convolutional Neural Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we have a number of 64x64 pixel thumbnails for each class that can be used to train a sea lion classification algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Keras on top of Tensorflow we can create a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) which can be used for 6 class classification.
The total number of classes is 6 because we have 5 classes of sea lions plus one class for thumbnails not matching any of those 5 classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model is defined with the following function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;create_model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Sequential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Dense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;512&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;relu&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Dropout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Dense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;softmax&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;compile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;categorical_crossentropy&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;optimizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;adam&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="n"&gt;metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;accuracy&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above model is a very naive and standard CNN. In &lt;strong&gt;line 4&lt;/strong&gt; a lambda function is used to normalise the pixel values in the range of &lt;code&gt;[-0.5, 0.5]&lt;/code&gt;.
The 64x64 thumbnails given as input have 3 channels (RGB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brute forcing object detection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to detect the number of sea lions on the test images the trained model was utilised in another spark job. 
The aim in this case was to receive the count of sea lions from every image in a dictionary like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;counts = {
        &amp;#39;adult_females&amp;#39;: 0,
        &amp;#39;adult_males&amp;#39;: 0,
        &amp;#39;juveniles&amp;#39;: 0,
        &amp;#39;non_seal&amp;#39;: 0,
        &amp;#39;pups&amp;#39;: 0,
        &amp;#39;subadult_males&amp;#39;: 0,
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new map function was defined, in which the input image was partitioned in non overlapping 64x64 thumbnails and each one of those 
was classified in one of the 6 available classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;results = sc.parallelize(files).map(util.count_sea_lions).collect()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classification step in the &lt;code&gt;count_sea_lions&lt;/code&gt; function was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;prediction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argmax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prediction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;counts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;classes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prediction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vertical Scaling on AWS EC2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the above spark jobs for the classification of 86GB of test images was a very slow process on my macbook.
In order to speed things up an EC2 instance with a significantly higher number of cores was employed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although spark is normally used with horizontal scaling, it can also be used to parallelise processes on multi-core machines. 
The vertical scaling was also chosen because I tried to avoid using AWS EMR and complex master-slave setups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Picking the right ec2 instance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the task seemed to be more CPU bound and optimising for cost was a nice-to-have I started looking for an ec2 spot instance that 
would satisfy both. To avoid using the ec2 price explorer provided on the AWS console UI I wrote a small script to present the 
currently available ec2 instances and their cost based on a number of "features". For this particular task I needed to find an ec2 instance
with at with 32 cores and the lowest price per core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script is availabe on github: &lt;a href="https://github.com/nicktgr15/ec2-spot-instance-finder"&gt;https://github.com/nicktgr15/ec2-spot-instance-finder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the results &lt;code&gt;r4.8xlarge&lt;/code&gt; was chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I had:
* a trained model
* the test dataset available on the ec2 instance (could have been s3 if it was bigger)
* spark configured on the 32-core ec2 instance (the setup was exactly the same as the one I had locally)
* a job that was receiving as input the filename of each one of the test images and was producing an output like the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    &amp;quot;adult_males&amp;quot;: 2, 
    &amp;quot;juveniles&amp;quot;: 30, 
    &amp;quot;pups&amp;quot;: 4, 
    &amp;quot;filename&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;15024.jpg&amp;quot;, 
    &amp;quot;adult_females&amp;quot;: 5, 
    &amp;quot;non_seal&amp;quot;: 5005, 
    &amp;quot;subadult_males&amp;quot;: 0
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spark job took around 15 hours to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results from the 18636 test images were aggregated and formatted to match the competition template.
The first few lines from the submission file were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_id,adult_males,subadult_males,adult_females,juveniles,pups
0,3,0,9,14,3
1,3,0,9,6,10
2,5,0,18,26,42
3,3,1,17,36,9
4,48,0,78,52,40
5,1,0,28,12,41
6,2,0,14,12,45
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file was submitted to kaggle and as expected it received a quite low score mainly due to the naivety of the approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/result.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The end&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of this experiment was mainly on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having a hands-on experience with spark employed as a parallel processing engine (on and off AWS)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using convnets with a Big dataset (this was the first time I was using convnets for an image classification task)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having a complete submission for the competition by spending just a couple of days on the problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of time spent on building the model was kept to as little as possible and of course there are many 
improvements that could be done on that side. Similarly, algorithms like &lt;em&gt;Selective Search&lt;/em&gt; could be employed to speed things up during the
classification etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closing, I'd say that I definitely learned a lot by participating and I hope that you also learned something new in this blog post.
I'm looking forward to comments and further discussion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Signal Generation / Sampling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to define an example signal that will be used for the analysis. A sine voltage signal would be appropriate in our case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$y = Asin(\omega t+\phi)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's create and sample our sine wave. (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A=1\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi=0\)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib.pyplot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;50.0&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="n"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of the above is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Signal Frequency: 50.0 Hz (Period: 20.0 ms)
Sampling Rate: 50.0 Hz, Duration: 5.0 s
Number of samples: 4000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;DFT calculation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's calculate the DFT using the above signal as input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dft&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DFT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;DFT bins: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dft_magnitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;f_nyquist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Nyquist frequency: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f_nyquist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; Hz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;DFT&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xlabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;bins&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ylabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;magnitude (V)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dft_magnitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;122&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xlabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;bins&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ylabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;magnitude (V)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;DFT (zoomed)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;arange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;245&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dft_magnitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;245&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of the above is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;DFT bins: 2000
Nyquist frequency: 400.0 Hz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:90%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/dft.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nyquist frequency is equal to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{1}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; of the sampling rate of a discrete signal processing system. Based on the fact that the Nyquist frequency is the maximum frequency we can have in our DFT spectrum we can calculate the DFT bin size as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dft_bin_width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f_nyquist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dft_magnitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;DFT bin width: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dft_bin_width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; Hz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;DFT bin width: 0.2 Hz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now redraw the DFT spectrum using Hz as the x-axis unit this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;figure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;figsize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;121&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;122&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;annotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;bin width &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%2.2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; Hz&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dft_bin_width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;xy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;50.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1800&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:90%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/dft-2.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peak in the DFT spectrum is, as expected, at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dft_magnitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argmax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dft_bin_width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; Hz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;50.00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Hz&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$DFT~bin~width = \frac{f_{nyquist}}{n_{samples}} = \frac{f_s / 2}{n_{samples}} $$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where, if we consider &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f_s\)&lt;/span&gt; constant, we conclude that DFT bin width is inversely proportional to the number of samples we use to calculate the DFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rephrasing, DFT &lt;strong&gt;frequency resolution is inversely proportional to the temporal resolution&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we should always not forget that by increasing the sampling rate we can get more samples in less time and consequently improve both our temporal and frequency resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand our conclusion we will explore how temporal and frequency resolution relate to each other with an example. Let's define a signal similar to the one we initially defined but this time containing 2 sine waves with frequencies equal to 50 and 60 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;50.0&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="n"&gt;f2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;55.0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1000.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;arange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;y1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;y2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Sampling Rate: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; Hz, Duration: 5.0 s&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Number of samples: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sampling Rate: 1000.0 Hz, Duration: 5.0 s
Number of samples: 5000
Nyquist frequency: 500.0 Hz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:80%;margin:auto;display:block;" src="images/dft-2-signals.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see how the number of samples (i.e. temporal resolution) affects the DFT bin size (i.e. frequency resolution) 
and when we have problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see that when the number of samples used to calculate the DFT (which is effectively the length of the 
analysis window) drops bellow 1000 we are unable to identify the two superimposed sine signals. Similarly, 
if we had a signal that changed rapidly over short periods of time, and we wanted to be able to track those changes 
in the time domain, then we would have to make sacrifices in our frequency domain resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the above analysis has helped you become a bit more familiar with the challenges we face 
when using this wonderful tool (i.e. the DFT). 
Hopefully, next time you'll have to decide about the size of your analysis window or the required sampling rate 
you will have the right arguments to support your decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
